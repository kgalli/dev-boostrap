This repository provides a bunch of setup scripts for my typical dev
environment. Right now this includes setup scripts for my bash, git and
Vim configuration.

Note: My VIM setup is actually based on [Janus Vim Distribution](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus).
It depends on having ruby (rake) and git installed on your system.

# Usage
Clone the dev-bootstrap repository into your home directory.

## Clone the dev-boostrap repository

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/kgalli/dev-bootstrap.git
```

Note that replacing https:// with git:// should also work.


## Run the setup script

```bash
cd ~/dev-bootstrap
./setup
```
